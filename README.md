### Markdown vs. PDF
ArAcademic is not an uploader for PDF files. In fact, the application focuses on writing an article: Distraction free editor with auto save and instant preview. The publisher should have it comfortable to write and publish a manuscript on any device. 

An academic publication should have a format that meets these requirements:
- readable
- exportable
- searchable
- formattable

Markdown is perfect.
